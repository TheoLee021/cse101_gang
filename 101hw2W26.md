## Question 4

Suppose there is a galaxy with n planets each with its own military. There are m treaties each involving two different planets (planet A and planet B) of the form: if planet A is at war, then planet B is obligated to join the war as an ally to A.

A planet alliance bloc is a group of planets such that if any one of them is at war, all the rest of the alliance bloc will join the war as an ally (either directly or through an intermediary.)

Design an algorithm that, given a list of n planets and a list of m treaties, labels each planet with a number such that two planets in the same alliance bloc are labeled with the same number.

(8 points for reasonably efficient correct high level algorithm description (with correctness proof), 4 points for correct time analysis, and 3 points for efficiency of your algorithm.)

**Answer**:

- Algorithm Description:

  Build a directed graph G = (V,E) where each planet is a vertex, and if planet A is obligated to go to war because of planet B, then there is a directed edge from B to A.

  Run SCC on G and assign each planet a label equal to the SCC number it belongs to.

  - Runtime:

  Running SCC takes O(|V|+|E|) time, and assigning labels to all vertices takes O|V|) time. Since O(|V| + |E|) is bigger, runtime is O(|V| + |E|).

- Justification of correctness:

(Showing that planets in the same alliance bloc recieve the same label)

Consider 2 planets u and v, which are both in the same SCC. By deffinition of SCC, there is a directed path from u to v and vice versa. If one of them goes to war, then the obligations go along these paths, forcing the other planet to join. Therefore, all planets in SCC form an alliance bloc and are correctly given the same label.

(Showing that planets in different SCCs cannot be in the same alliance bloc)

Consider 2 planets u and v, which are in different SCC. This means at least 1 of them cannot be reached frrom the other. Therefore, there exist a situation that if a planet goes to war, the other is not obligated to join. Therefore, planets in different SCCs cannot be in the same alliance bloc. They recieve different labels.
