%FIRST PROBLEM

\item (10 points)\\
\emph{[The purpose of this problem is to review a few concepts we will need in this class: asymptotic notation, recurrence relations and induction]}

Recall that the definition of Big-Oh is:
\begin{quote}
$f(n) = O(g(n))$ means that there exists a real number $C>0$ and an integer $k>0$ such that

$$f(n) \leq C*g(n)~~~for~~~all~~~n\geq k$$
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Prove the following statement:

\begin{quote}
$2^n*(n!)^2 = O((2n)!)$.
\end{quote}

[Hint: prove by induction.]

\item
Define the sequence $D(n)$ recursively in the following way: $D(0) = 1, D(1)=2$ and
$$D(n) = (1/2) D(n-1) + 2D(n-2)~~~~for~~~~n\geq 2$$

Prove that $D(n) = O\left( 2^n\right)$

\end{enumerate}



% SECOND PROBLEM


\item (10 points)
\emph{[This problem is designed to give a concrete example of a graph with $n$ vertices such that the number of paths grows faster than any exponential (in terms of $n$). This is important later when we start looking for paths with specific properties (shortest paths, paths of even or odd length, paths that avoid certain vertices, etc.) Some of you will be tempted to say ``Search all paths....." but this may require a runtime that grows exponentially or faster. It is important to note that DFS, BFS,... do not search all paths since these algorithms are polynomial time.]}

Let $B(n)$ be the $n$th \emph{Complete Balanced Bipartite Graph} on $2n$ vertices. $B(n)$ has $2n$ vertices $n$ on each side. One side has vertices labeled $a_1,\dots,a_n$ and the other side has vertices labeled $b_1,\dots,b_n$. There is an edge connecting $a_i$ and $b_j$ for all $1\leq i,j\leq n$

Below is the graph of $B(3):$

\includegraphics[scale = 0.2]{Bipartite}


\begin{enumerate}
\item
How many edges does $B(n)$ have? (no justification necessary)
\item
Let $H(n)$ be the number of Hamiltonian paths of $B(n)$  that start from an $a_i$ vertex and ends at a $b_j$ vertex (Hamiltonian paths are paths that go through each vertex exactly once.)

Give an explanation as to why $H(n) = (n!)^2$

\item
Let $P(N)$ be the number of Hamiltonian paths of a Complete Bipartite Graph on $N$ vertices. Determine the big-Theta bound of $P(N)$.
\end{enumerate}



\item (10 points)\\
\emph{[This main motivation for this problem is to practice designing algorithms and pseudocode as well as interacting with graphs using adjacency matrices.]}

An adjacency matrix for an undirected graph with vertices labeled $1$ through $n$ is a symmetric matrix such that entry $(i,j)$ is 1 if there is an edge between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$ and 0 otherwise.

Example:
Here is a graph and its adjacency matrix.

%\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{adjacency matrix}

A {\em triangle}  in an undirected, simple graph is a set of three 
distinct vertices $x, y, z$ such that all pairs are connected by an edge. 

You are given $A$, the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph $G$.

Design an algorithm that \emph{determines} (outputs True or False) whether $G$ has a \emph{triangle} or not.

(You can present your algorithm using pseudocode. Please also include a runtime analysis. You do not need to write a proof of correctness for this problem (but it would be helpful to think of one.))




%FOURTH PROBLEM
\item (10 points) \\
\emph{[The main motivation for this problem is to see what a \emph{reduction} algorithm looks like. Also, in this problem, you will practice writing a bi-directional proof for an algorithm that solves a decision problem.]}\\
Given a directed graph $G$ with vertex weights $w_v\in\{0,1,2\}$ (in other words, each vertex is either labeled with a,b or c), and vertices $s$ and $t$, 
Determine if there is a path in $G$ from $s$ to $t$ such that the sequence of vertex labels in the path goes in weakly increasing order.

{\bf Algorithm Description:}
Consider the following algorithm that claims to solve this problem: 
alphabetical
\begin{quote}

Input: a $\{0,1,2\}$-labeled directed graph $G$, a vertex $s$ of $G$ and a vertex $t$ of $G$.

Create a graph $G'$ by removing all edges $(u,v)$ such that $w(u) > w(v)$.

Run graphsearch on $G'$ starting from $s$. If $t$ is visited then return TRUE. Otherwise return FALSE

\end{quote}




(NOTE: \emph{graphsearch} is an algorithm that takes a graph $G$ and a vertex $s$ and returns a list of vertices that are reachable from $s$ by a directed path in $G$.
You do not have to prove the correctness of \emph{graphsearch}, we will do this in class.)



Prove that this algorithm is correct.

(Hint: your proof must show that the algorithm correctly returns TRUE when the input has the desired property and correctly returns FALSE when the input does not have the desired property. This means you must do a bi-directional proof.)
