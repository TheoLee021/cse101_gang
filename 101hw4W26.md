## Question 2
Suppose you have an energy network given by a connected undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with positive edge weights (that represent the maintenance cost of each edge.) You are allowed to build $k$ power-plants each at a different vertex of the graph.

Design an algorithm that return the locations of the power-plants and the edges of the minimum weight sub-forest of $k$ trees such that each tree has one power-plants and every vertex is part of a tree.

**High level algorithm:**
Since given a connected undirected graph $G$ with $n,m \in G$. After running *kruskal's* algorithm $Kruskal(G)$ for $G$, we will get a subset of edges $T \subseteq E$ Minimum Spanning Tree $T$. Then, to sort all the edges $e \in T$ in descending order. After the sort algorithm, we cut/remove $k-1$ heaviest edges $e$ from $T$. Now, we got a minimum weight sub-forest of $k$ tree. Then, we chose the any of one vertex from the minimum weight sub-forest (location on each tress doesn't matter) as $k$ power-plants, and put it in $L$ location set. Finally, return the set $L$ and all edges $e\in T$.

**Correctness:**

First, let establish that the optimal answer must be a spanning forest consisting of exactly $k$ tree such that each for each $k$ tree from this forest. If any edge $e$ in the tree is cut, it will produce another isolate tree that disconnecting with other. It remind $k+1$ tree in this forest.

Exchange Argument: Let $g$ be the heaviest edge as the first greedy decision in $T$. Let $AS\subseteq T$ be an arbitrary solution that does **NOT** contain $g$. Then the solution $AS'\subseteq T$ that contains $g$ and $AS'$ is at least as good as $AS$.

To prove that $AS'$ has valid structure since running *kruskal's* algorithm for $G$, it will produces a subset $T$ Minimum Spanning Tree. Therefore, $G(V,T)$ is a sub-forest, and any tree for this sub-forest has no path to each other, then it satisfies the structure of result. Then, after cutting any $k-1$ edges from $T$, it still remains a sub-forest of $G$. In conclusion, $AS'$ is a valid structure and the value of $|AS'| \ge |AS|$.

Base case: Assume the instance size $n = 1$, the greedy choice $g \in T$ is the only choice to satisfy constraints. Thus, $GS$ is optimal for $n=1$. 

Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that for all instance of size $k < n$, the greedy algorithm produces an optimal solution.

Inductive Step: Let $g$ be first greed decision for the instance $I$ of size $n$. Let $I'$ be the set that is not contains $g$, and $GS=g \cup S(I')$, where $S(I')$ is some solution of $I$. As know as, $AS$ is any legal solution and $AS'$ is the other case of solution that contains $g$ by the Exchange Augment. Therefore, $AS' = g \cup GS(I')$.

Conclusion: $|AS| \le |AS'| = |g \cup AS(I')|  \le |g \cup S(I')|  = |GS(I)|$, then, $GS$ is optimal for the minimum weight sub-forest of $k$ tree.

**Time Analysis:**
- Running *kruskal's* algorithm for $G$ takes $O((n+m)log(n))$ time.
- Running the sort algorithm for $e\in T$ takes $O(mlog(m))$ time
- Cutting edges from sub-forest takes $O(m)$ time since $k\le m - 1$.
- Adding any power-plants in the forest takes $O(n)$ time since $k \le n$.

Therefore, the time complexity of this algorithm is $O((n+m)log(n))$.
